# RShell

Simple shell written in Rust.

## Why

Wanted to brush up my Rust skills so decided to write a shell program to do so.

## Using

Build the shell by using 'cargo build --release'. The binary for the shell is located at ./targer/release/shell.

*Built In Functions:*
- Exit - 'exit'
- Change Dir - 'cd <arg>'
- Current Directory - 'pwd'

## After Word
Feel free to use this as a template and starting point for your own projects. This is by no means complete and even the built in functions are not quite complete. Happy Hacking!
